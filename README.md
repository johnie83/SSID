# SSID
Smart Card Authentication based on Singapore standard SS 529:2006 
SS 529:2006 is very similar to ICAO standard.

The standard itself doesn't clearly define the encryption method, or any detailed authentication or data verification flow. So it will be slightly different on every implementation.
